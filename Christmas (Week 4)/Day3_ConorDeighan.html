            Why did the shepherd bring a ladder to the manger? <br>
            Because he heard the star was “leading the way” and wanted a better view!

            The Nativity refers to the birth of Jesus Christ, a central event in Christian tradition and the focus of Christmas celebrations. According to the biblical accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary and Joseph, who had traveled there due to a Roman census. With no room available at the inn, Jesus was placed in a manger, symbolizing humility and simplicity. The event is often depicted with key figures such as shepherds who were guided by angels to visit the newborn, and later the wise men, or Magi, who followed a bright star to bring gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Nativity scenes—featuring the Holy Family, animals, angels, and the star—have become a traditional way of remembering and celebrating this moment around the world.
